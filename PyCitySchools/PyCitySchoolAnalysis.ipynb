    "# PyCity Schools Analysis \n",

    "There are 39170 students in total of 15 schools categorised into two school types.\n",
    "Overall pass percentage of students in these 15 schools is 72.81% and Total budget of all schools is $24649428.00\n",
    "Top 5 Highest performing schools by overall passing percentage are Cabrera High School, Thomas High School, Griffin High School, Wilson High School and Pena High School. All Top 5 performing schools are Charter schools.\n",
    "5 Bottom performing schools by overall passing percentage are Rodriguez High School, Figueroa High School, Huang High School, Hernandez High School and Johnson High School. All bottom 5 performing schools are District schools.\n",
    "Every school is consistent across all grades 9th,10th,11th and 12th grades in passing percentage in math, reading or overall.\n",
    "Per capita spending on each student ranges upto $680\n",
    "Spending Ranges has no direct relation to Overall pass percentage of students.\n",
    "All district schools are Large Schools containing students size upto 5000 students\n",
    "Small to Medium size schools are performing better by Over all passing percentage compared to Large Schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "Spending Ranges has no direct relation to Overall pass percentage of students.\n",
    "Small to Medium size schools are performing better in achieving Overall passing percentage compared to Large Schools.\n",
    "All Top 5 performing schools are Charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using above information in analysis section, Increasing per student budget may not guarantee performance improvement rather spending per student budget on right resources may improve overall performance of school. Reducing size of large schools may show better results. By Implementing Learnings from Charter schools in district schools may show improvements in overall passing percentage. \n"
